#Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern allows you to change the desired behavior of a class without requiring recompilation, potentially even during run-time execution. 

To understand when the Strategy pattern is best applied, you can look at instances of conditional branching. Whenever you use switch statements, you can use the Strategy pattern to simplify the client so that it delegates complexity to dependent interfaces.
