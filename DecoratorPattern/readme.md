# Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern's basic premise is that each decorator class fulfills the contract of a type and also accepts one or more of those types as contructors parameters. 
This is beneficial because functionality can be added to an existing class that implements a certain interface, and the decorator also acts as an implementation of the required interface.
